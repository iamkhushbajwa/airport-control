airport-control
--
This allows one to control the flow of planes, allowing them to land or take-off accordingly.

If the weather is Stormy, it doesn't allow take-off or landing at that particular airport.

The chances of it being Stormy than Sunny are less.

To run, enter irb in the Terminal

Require the two clases Airport and Plane, and create instances of them.

See each class for the methods that can be performed on them.


# Feedback

allow_landing sounds like a question rather than a command. Whats wrong with calling land directly?
```
airport.land(plane)
```
This demonstrates a good understanding of oop, but you don't really need to test this.
```
it "ensures only planes based there can take" do
```
